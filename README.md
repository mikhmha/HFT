# About
algot.io is a website I made to visualize the live performance of a high frequency trading algorithm I wrote in C++. The algorithim runs locally while also logging transactions asynchronously to the cloud. The site is currently testing so its quite buggy.

There are some more features planned for the site. The next major feature planned is for the ability for users to influence the algorithm via voting in periodically generated polls on the website. This will tweak algorithm parameters to find buy/sell limits. This feature is currently testing.

The assets currently being traded on algot are not real. They are simulated and traded based on (real) real-time trading data. Exchange fees are currently not accounted for by the algorithm. Only cryptocurrencies are being traded right now since getting live stock data (to the milisecond) is very expensive.
