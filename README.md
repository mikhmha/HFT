# About
algot.io is a website I made to visualize the live performance of a high frequency trading algorithm I wrote in C++. The algorithim runs locally while also logging transactions asynchronously to the cloud. The site is currently testing so its quite buggy.

There are some more features planned for the site. The next major feature planned is for the ability for users to influence the algorithm. This feature is currently testing.

Only cryptocurrencies are being traded right now since getting live stock data is very expensive.
